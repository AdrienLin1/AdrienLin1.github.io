<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
👋Hello! I am currently a third-year M.Sc. student at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)(UCAS),and doing my research at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Prof. Yunduan Cui](https://cuiyunduan.vercel.app/).

Before this, I received Bachelor of Network Engineering from [Anhui University](https://en.ahu.edu.cn/) in 2021. And from 2019 to 2020, I went to the [Conservatoire national des arts et métiers](https://www.cnam.eu/) (Cnam) in France for an exchange program and participated in project research under the guidance of professors in France.

My research interests lie in the reinforcement learning and robot learning, especially in complex systems, like quadrupedal robot, HVAC system, chemical production control etc.
